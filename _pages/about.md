I’m a recent Civil Engineering graduate from BUET, where I majored in Transportation and minored in Structural Engineering. My work focuses on solving urban mobility challenges through the lens of machine learning, optimization, and network science. I’m especially drawn to transportation because of its interdisciplinary nature — it connects civil engineering with computer science, urban planning, economics, and human behavior.

## Research Identity

I’m passionate about solving urban mobility challenges through interdisciplinary approaches that blend transportation engineering with machine learning, optimization, and network science. I’ve long been fascinated by intelligent systems and their potential to support smarter decision-making in cities.

My recent work explores topics like pedestrian behavior modeling, transit accessibility, emergency response optimization, and agent-based mobility simulations. I’m especially interested in how reinforcement learning, game theory, and multi-agent coordination can improve the resilience and efficiency of urban transport networks.

## Recent Projects

- **Pedestrian Behavior Analysis:** Custom-trained YOLOv8 and DeepSORT to detect and track pedestrians; evaluated unpredictability using entropy and chaos theory.  
- **Transit Access Heatmap for Dhaka:** Clustered 1,800+ bus stops using DBSCAN and visualized service intensity in QGIS.  
- **Emergency Response Simulation:** Modeled emergency dispatch on dynamic urban grids using Monte Carlo simulation and edge vulnerability mapping.

## Research Interests

I’m broadly interested in intelligent transportation systems and how cities can be made more adaptive, efficient, and equitable. My current interests include:

- Machine learning and optimization for urban mobility  
- Network science and resilience in transportation systems  
- Human-centered and accessible mobility planning

## What I’m Working On

I’m currently exploring research ideas at the intersection of transportation systems, AI, and optimization, while preparing for graduate study in Transportation Engineering. My focus is on building a strong foundation in intelligent mobility systems through self-driven projects, technical learning, and academic collaborations.

## Beyond Research

Outside of academics, I enjoy exploring cities through maps and thinking up unconventional ideas — like using particle swarm coordination for public transport. I’m also a sports enthusiast who follows Formula 1, football, and cricket, not for the teams but for the beauty of the games themselves. In quieter moments, I like diving into the math behind machine learning models and understanding how these systems really work.
