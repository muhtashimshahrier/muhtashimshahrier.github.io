I'm Muhtashim Shahrier, a transportation researcher from BUET. My work explores the intersection of machine learning, optimization, and network science for solving urban mobility challenges.

Recent projects include:
- Pedestrian behavior analysis using custom-trained YOLOv8 and entropy metrics
- Transit access heatmap for Dhaka using DBSCAN and QGIS
- Emergency response simulation on dynamic urban grids with Monte Carlo methods

I'm especially interested in reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems, and resilient transport networks.

You can find my [CV](/files/cv.pdf), [research projects](/portfolio/), and thesis work on this site.

## About Me

I graduated from BUET with a major in Transportation and a minor in Structural Engineering. My academic interests lie in the intersection of transportation systems and intelligent decision-making, particularly through reinforcement learning, optimization, and network science.

### Research Interests

- Adaptive traffic control and emergency response using RL
- Public transit accessibility and service equity
- Game theory in connected vehicle systems
- Transportation network resilience

I'm currently preparing applications for Fall 2026 MS programs in Transportation Engineering and working on multiple independent research projects related to emergency response optimization and urban mobility in Dhaka.

Beyond research, I enjoy exploring cities through maps, solving transportation puzzles, and learning languages â€” currently, I'm learning German.
