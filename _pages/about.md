I’m a recent Civil Engineering graduate from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), where I majored in Transportation and minored in Structural Engineering. I’m interested in the intersection of machine learning, optimization, and network science for solving urban mobility challenges. I’m drawn to transportation for its interdisciplinary nature — connecting civil engineering with computer science, planning, economics, and human behavior.

## Current Focus

I’m currently exploring how intelligent systems can make cities more adaptive, efficient, and equitable. My academic interests include urban network modeling, AI in mobility, and transportation system resilience. I’m also preparing for graduate studies in Transportation Engineering and developing self-driven projects that blend technical depth with real-world relevance.

## Beyond Research

Outside of academics, I enjoy imagining strange, futuristic (sometimes dystopian) ways mobility could evolve. From underground bike highways to teleportation networks where vehicles have minds of their own, I like daydreaming about systems that don't exist — yet. I’m also a sports enthusiast who follows Formula 1, football, and cricket, not for the teams but for the beauty of the games themselves. In quieter moments, I like diving into the math behind machine learning models and understanding how these systems really work.
