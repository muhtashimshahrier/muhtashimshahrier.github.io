I’m a Civil Engineering graduate from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), where I specialized in Transportation Engineering. My research interests broadly include data-driven and computational approaches to transportation systems, integrating concepts from machine learning, optimization, and system modeling to enhance mobility, safety, and efficiency in urban networks. I’m particularly motivated by interdisciplinary problems that combine engineering, behavior, and computation to address real-world transport challenges. I’m especially interested in how intelligent methods, can enable resilient, equitable, and sustainable urban transport systems under uncertainty.

## Beyond Research

Outside of academics, I enjoy imagining strange, futuristic (sometimes dystopian) ways mobility could evolve. From underground bike highways to teleportation networks where vehicles have minds of their own, I like daydreaming about systems that don't exist — yet. I’m also a sports enthusiast who follows Formula 1, football, and cricket, not for the teams but for the beauty of the games themselves. In quieter moments, I like diving into the math behind machine learning models and understanding how these systems really work.
