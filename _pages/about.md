I’m a Civil Engineering graduate from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), where I majored in Transportation and minored in Structural Engineering. I’m interested in the intersection of machine learning, optimization, and network science for tackling urban mobility challenges. I’m drawn to transportation for its interdisciplinary nature — where engineering connects with computer science, planning, economics, and human behavior. Above all, I believe transportation isn’t just about movement — it’s about shaping access, opportunity, and quality of life. I’m especially interested in how intelligent systems can contribute to more inclusive, equitable, and resilien transportation system.

## Beyond Research

Outside of academics, I enjoy imagining strange, futuristic (sometimes dystopian) ways mobility could evolve. From underground bike highways to teleportation networks where vehicles have minds of their own, I like daydreaming about systems that don't exist — yet. I’m also a sports enthusiast who follows Formula 1, football, and cricket, not for the teams but for the beauty of the games themselves. In quieter moments, I like diving into the math behind machine learning models and understanding how these systems really work.
