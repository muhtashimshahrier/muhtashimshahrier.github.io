I’m a recent Civil Engineering graduate from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), where I majored in Transportation Engineering and minored in Structural Engineering. My interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, optimization, and uncertainty modeling in transportation systems — particularly in data-driven approaches to understand and predict behavior in complex urban environments. I’m drawn to transportation engineering because of its interdisciplinary nature — blending engineering, planning, economics, and human behavior. I believe thoughtful research can create real impact, and I’m driven by the goal of contributing meaningfully to solving complex, real-world challenges. I’m especially interested in how intelligent systems — including optimization-based and learning-based models — can enable resilient, equitable, and efficient urban transport under uncertainty.

## Beyond Research

Outside of academics, I enjoy imagining strange, futuristic (sometimes dystopian) ways mobility could evolve. From underground bike highways to teleportation networks where vehicles have minds of their own, I like daydreaming about systems that don't exist — yet. I’m also a sports enthusiast who follows Formula 1, football, and cricket, not for the teams but for the beauty of the games themselves. In quieter moments, I like diving into the math behind machine learning models and understanding how these systems really work.
