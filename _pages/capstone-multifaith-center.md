As part of our undergraduate capstone project at BUET, I led a 7-member team in the planning and technical design of a proposed **Multifaith Center** in Azimpur, Dhaka. The project included a full pre-construction feasibility study, detailed structural and plumbing design, environmental assessments, cost analysis, and a dedicated **Traffic Impact Assessment (TIA)**.

The goal was to integrate interfaith accessibility, structural safety, traffic management, and sustainable development into a cohesive real-world proposal.
