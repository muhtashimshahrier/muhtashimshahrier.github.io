title: "Application of Chaos Theory to Evaluate Pedestrian Behavior using Deep Learning based Video Analytics in Different Diurnal Variations"
permalink: /chaos-thesis/

**Undergraduate Thesis, BUET**

Developed a custom-trained YOLOv8 model using a custom made dataset to detect nighttime road users in Bangladesh.
Pedestrian trajectories were extracted using the DeepSORT tracking algorithm.
To assess behavioral patterns, trajectories from both daytime and nighttime footage were analyzed using chaos theory — specifically Lyapunov Exponents and Approximate Entropy — to evaluate the unpredictability of pedestrian movement.

**Keywords**: pedestrian behavior, chaos theory, YOLO, DeepSORT, approximate entropy, lyaounov exponent
