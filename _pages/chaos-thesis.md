**Undergraduate Thesis, BUET (March 2025)**

In high-density cities like Dhaka, pedestrian behavior varies significantly with environmental and traffic context. This thesis investigates whether chaotic patterns emerge in pedestrian trajectories and how these patterns differ between daytime and nighttime conditions. The study blends deep learning-based video analytics with chaos theory to analyze behavioral unpredictability in naturalistic urban settings.

The project involved training a custom YOLOv8 model to detect road users (pedestrians and vehicles) in nighttime conditions, followed by DeepSORT-based tracking to extract pedestrian trajectories. These trajectories were then analyzed using Lyapunov Exponents and Approximate Entropy to quantify chaos.

This work is currently being extended to a pedestrian-level predictive framework, where each pedestrianâ€™s behavior is characterized using trajectory-based, environmental, and group interaction features. The goal is to train a supervised learning model that can classify behavior as chaotic or stable. This extension reflects my broader interest in learning-based modeling of complex, naturalistic traffic behavior under uncertainty.

**Highlights:**

- Trained a custom YOLOv8 model for detecting road users in nighttime urban conditions.

- Used DeepSORT to extract and track pedestrian trajectories from raw video.

- Applied Lyapunov Exponents and Approximate Entropy to analyze behavioral unpredictability.

- Currently extending to pedestrian-level classification using trajectory, vehicle context, and group behavior features.
