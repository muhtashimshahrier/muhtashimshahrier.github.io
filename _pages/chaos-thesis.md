title: "Application of Chaos Theory to Evaluate Pedestrian Behavior using Deep Learning based Video Analytics in Different Diurnal Variations"
permalink: /chaos-thesis/
---

**Undergraduate Thesis, BUET (March 2025)**

In high-density cities like Dhaka, pedestrian behavior varies significantly across lighting conditions. This thesis explores whether **chaotic patterns** exist in pedestrian movement and how these differ between **daytime and nighttime**.

**Highlights:**
- Trained a **custom YOLOv8 model** to detect road users (vehicles, pedestrians) in nighttime using urban footage from Dhaka.
- Used **DeepSORT** to extract pedestrian trajectories from video data.
- Applied **Lyapunov Exponents** and **Approximate Entropy** to analyze behavioral unpredictability in both diurnal conditions.

**Tools:** Python, YOLOv8, DeepSORT, OpenCV, NumPy, matplotlib  
**Keywords:** pedestrian behavior, chaos theory, YOLO, DeepSORT, approximate entropy, Lyapunov exponent
