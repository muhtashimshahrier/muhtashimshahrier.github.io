## Facility Location Optimization on a Synthetic Grid Using Monte Carlo Simulation

This project simulates optimal facility placement on a synthetic 5Ã—5 grid under travel time uncertainty. Each edge in the grid has a travel time drawn from a Gaussian distribution to reflect stochastic conditions. Monte Carlo simulation (1000 runs) is used to evaluate each facilityâ€™s performance based on travel time to random demand nodes.

The objective is to identify the most robust facility locations using average, 95th percentile, and worst-case travel times.

### Key Steps

- **Grid Generation**: Built a 5Ã—5 grid network using NetworkX, with integer-labeled nodes.
- **Travel Time Modeling**: Assigned normally distributed travel times to each edge (mean and 20% standard deviation).
- **Demand Selection**: Randomly selected 5 demand nodes per simulation run; remaining nodes were used as facility candidates.
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Ran 1000 iterations, re-sampling edge travel times each time to simulate variability.
- **Facility Evaluation**: Ranked candidates based on average, 95th percentile, and worst-case travel time to all demand points.
- **Visualization**: Used matplotlib to plot network and highlight selected demand points.
