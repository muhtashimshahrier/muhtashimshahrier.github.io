This project implements the classical four-step travel demand model â€” **trip generation, trip distribution, mode choice, and traffic assignment** â€” from scratch for a synthetic 5-zone city. Each step was programmed and executed using Python, with full control over inputs and logic.

The goal was to develop a custom-coded version of the four-step model as a hands-on learning exercise in demand modeling and transport systems analysis.

## ðŸ”„ Model Steps

- **Trip Generation**: Synthetic population, household, and employment data were used to generate trips from each zone.
- **Trip Distribution**: Gravity model used to estimate OD matrix based on impedance (travel cost).
- **Mode Choice**: Simplified multinomial logit model to allocate trips to private or public modes.
- **Traffic Assignment**: Deterministic shortest-path assignment using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- Python
- NumPy, pandas
- NetworkX (for graph-based assignment)
- Matplotlib (for basic plotting)

---

## ðŸ“Š Outputs
- Zone-level O-D matrices for both Auto and Transit
- Network graph with edge labels for travel time and capacity
- All-or-nothing assigned flows visualized using edge width
