Welcome to my Projects page! Here I showcase a mixture of simulation-based work and academic projects in transportation engineering and urban planning.

## ðŸ§ª Simulation Projects

- [Reinforcement Learning for Emergency Dispatch](#)  
  *An in-depth project using RL with Monte Carlo simulation to optimize emergency response routing in uncertain urban environments.*

- [Transit Access Heatmap in Dhaka](#)  
  *DBSCAN-based clustering of 3,000+ bus stops and GIS heatmap generation to evaluate transit service intensity.*

- [Four-Step Travel Demand Model (Synthetic City)](#)  
  *Implements trip generation, distribution, mode choice, and traffic assignment for a synthetic 7-zone city.*

## ðŸ“˜ Academic Coursework Projects

- [Capstone: Multifaith Center Development in Azimpur](/capstone-multifaith/) 
  *Led a team project involving site planning, structural ang geotechnical design, environmental analysis, and Traffic Impact Assessment for a proposed multifaith center in Dhaka.*

- [Trip Generation Modeling (Term Project)](#)  
  *Regression-based modeling of trip generation using socio-economic variables for Dhaka households.*
