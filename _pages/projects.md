Welcome to my Projects page! Here I showcase a mixture of simulation-based work and academic projects in transportation engineering and urban planning.

## ðŸ§ª Simulation Projects

- [Facility Location Optimization on a Synthetic Grid Using Monte Carlo Simulation](/facility-location/)  
  *Simulates facility placement using Monte Carlo sampling and shortest-path analysis under edge-level travel time uncertainty.*

- [Reinforcement Learning for Emergency Dispatch](#)  
  *An in-depth project using RL with Monte Carlo simulation to optimize emergency response routing in uncertain urban environments.*

- [Bus Route Access Heatmap in Dhaka](/bus-access-heatmap/)  
  *Spatial clustering of geocoded bus stops and GIS-based heatmap generation to visualize service intensity and identify underserved areas in Dhaka.*


- [Four-Step Travel Demand Model (Synthetic City)](/four-step-model/)  
  *Implements trip generation, distribution, mode choice, and traffic assignment for a synthetic 5-zone city.*

## ðŸ“˜ Academic Coursework Projects

- [Capstone Project: Multifaith Center Development in Azimpur](/capstone-multifaith/)   
  *Led a team project involving site planning, structural ang geotechnical design, environmental analysis, and Traffic Impact Assessment for a proposed multifaith center in Dhaka.*

- [Trip Generation Modeling (Term Project)](/trip-generation-modeling/)  
  *Regression-based modeling of weekday trip generation for students in Dhaka using socio-economic predictors and variable selection techniques.*
