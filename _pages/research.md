Here are some of my research projects:

## Undergraduate Thesis
- [Chaos in Pedestrian Behavior](/chaos-thesis/)  
  Explored chaotic dynamics of pedestrian movement in Dhaka’s mixed-traffic intersections using YOLOv8-based detection, DeepSORT tracking, and chaos-theoretic measures (Lyapunov Exponent, Approximate Entropy).
