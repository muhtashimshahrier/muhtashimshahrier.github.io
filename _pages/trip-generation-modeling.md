As part of the **Urban Transportation Planning and Management** course (CE 457), I completed a term project on **trip generation modeling** using regression analysis, focusing on weekday trip-making behavior of students in Dhaka. This was a supervised academic assignment using confidential data.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Methodology

- Applied **one-hot encoding** and **forward elimination** to identify suitable variables
- Built a linear regression model using five socio-economic predictors
- Interpreted coefficient signs and values based on logical and behavioral reasoning
- Evaluated the model using adjusted RÂ² and statistical significance of variables

---

## ðŸ›  Tools Used

- Python (`pandas`, `statsmodels`)
- Excel (for data cleaning and summaries)

---

This project helped reinforce my understanding of regression modeling and variable selection in the context of urban travel behavior.
