### YouTube Comment Metadata Analysis in Bangladesh  
**Collaborative Independent Project**

Conducted an independent study to analyze audience engagement on Bangladeshi YouTube videos using comment metadata. Collected and examined over **20,000 comments** from popular channels, focusing on **likes, replies**, and **comment types**.

Videos were categorized by genre (e.g., music, news, vlogs), and comments were grouped into types such as **informative**, **promotional**, **positive**, and **negative**. The study explored how content genre influences the nature and volume of user engagement.
