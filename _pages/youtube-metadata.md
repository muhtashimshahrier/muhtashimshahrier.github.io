### Analyzing YouTube Comment Metadata to Understand Engagement Patterns  
**Collaborative Independent Project**

Participated in a small, unofficial research effort exploring audience engagement on Bangladeshi YouTube videos.  
Collected over 20,000 comments from popular Bangladeshi YouTube videos and analyzed engagement patterns using metadata (likes, replies) and comment types.   
Videos were categorized by genre, and comments were grouped into categories such as informative, promotional, positive, and negative.  
The study explored how different genres attract different types of comments and engagement behaviors.
